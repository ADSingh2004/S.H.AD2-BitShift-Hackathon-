The hip and torso motion are similar to a kettlebell swing, as are the muscles it targets, including the hamstrings, glutes, upper back, and grip. However, unlike the traditional kettlebell swing, the arms are outside of the knees. This movement can be performed for time or for reps, but is usually performed for relatively high reps, such as 8-12 sets per rep or more, as part of a fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout.\nType: Strength\nBody Part: Lower Back\nEquipment: Dumbbell\nLevel: Intermediate",

Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.\nType: Strength\nBody Part: Quadriceps\nEquipment: Barbell\nLevel: Intermediate",

It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.\nType: Strength\nBody Part: Quadriceps\nEquipment: Barbell\nLevel: Intermediate",

The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.\nType: Strength\nBody Part: Quadriceps\nEquipment: Dumbbell\nLevel: Intermediate",

It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. The angle of a landmine press is usually somewhere between an incline press and a military press, and the movement focuses primarily on the muscles of the shoulders or deltoids. It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges or for higher reps.\nType: Strength\nBody Part: Shoulders\nEquipment: Other\nLevel: Intermediate",

It approximates the motion of a free-weight shoulder press, but uses a selectorized weight-stack or plate-loaded machine. Many such machines also allow you to choose between different grips and grip widths. Machine shoulder presses are often done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.\nType: Strength\nBody Part: Shoulders\nEquipment: Machine\nLevel: Intermediate",
